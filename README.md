## Course Project

_Course Instructor: Dr. Richa Singh_

## Natural Image Classification (CIFAR 10)

> Natural Image Classification is one of the hot topics in computer vision and pattern recognition research. In recent years scene understanding and object classification has received intense attention as it is beneficial for many practical applications such as autonomous driving, robot vision and content-based image retrieval.
> The project aims at classifying images under 10 labels that includes Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship and Truck.
> The classifier used for the project is Convolutional Neural Network which is trained on CIFAR 10 dataset, which came out to be best if compared to KNN, SVM, MLP and Random Forest trained with the same data.
